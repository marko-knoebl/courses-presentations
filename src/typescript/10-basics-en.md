# TypeScript Basics

<!-- closely realated content in presentations typescript and react-->

## TypeScript

= superset of JavaScript with extensions:

- **static typing**
- public / private properties
- decorators

## Static typing

data types may be specified in order to support the development environment:

- auto completion
- errors when types mismatch

## Static typing

during build: TypeScript is translated to JavaScript, all type information is discarded

## Type declarations for libraries

some libraries include TypeScript declarations - e.g. _redux_.

other popular libraries mostly have type declaration packages that are prefixed with _@types_

e.g. for _react_: _@types/react_
